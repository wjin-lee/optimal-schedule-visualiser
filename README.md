# Optimal Schedule Visualiser

This repository contains the visualiser part of the larger optimal schedule solver developed during my SOFTENG 306 course. It exists solely to showcase my web development capabilities as a part of my portfolio.

The entire optimal schedule solver has not been provided here for a couple reasons:
1. The solver was a team effort. I only feel comfortable uploading the visualiser component as this was created independently.
2. There is a risk of the repository getting flagged if the entire source code was copied and submitted by somebody else. (Especially as the lecturer seems to reuse his assignments.)
